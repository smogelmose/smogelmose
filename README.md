## Hi there 👋

Thanks for stopping by!

I have a passion for exploring new technologies with a focus on human beings.    
  
I'm currently working on:
  
🦻 Creating a digital Reynell test that meets the needs of children with Cochlear Implants.  
🧘 Developing a Virtual environment that provides a safe space for individuals with ASD.
