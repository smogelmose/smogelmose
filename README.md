## Hi there 👋

Thanks for stopping by! 
  
# 👋 About Me  

I hold a **BSc in Medialogy** from Aalborg University Copenhagen and specialize in immersive technologies, human‑computer interaction, and user‑centered design. My background spans both research and creative‑industry projects, covering:

- Game and film development  
- Biometric sensing & AI integration  
- Interaction design & experimental research  
- Cybersickness mitigation in VR  
- Creative technology & digital media production  

I currently work part‑time as a **Student Assistant** at the **Creative Technology Lab (AAU CREATE)**, helping students and staff with lab resources and technical equipment.

## 🔬 Research Highlight  

**Balance VR Project – Multisensory Experience Lab, AAU CREATE**  
Investigated how spatialized sound influences sensory conflict and the interplay between balance and motion sickness in virtual reality. This work grew out of my bachelor group project and contributed to a larger research initiative.
